PROPERTIES OF TREE:
1. Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^h – 1.
	 Height of a tree with single node is considered as 1.
2. The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^l-1.
	Here level is number of nodes on path from root to the node (including root and node). Level of root is 1.
3. In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is, Log2(N+1) //leaf node start @0
4. Array formula:
	left child:
	right child:
	parent:
